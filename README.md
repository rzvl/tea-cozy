## General Information

This is a one page website for a fictional company called **Tea Cozy**. It has
a very basic and minimalistic design.


## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3


## Setup

The design was provided by codecademy in the form of a JPEG image. I created
the HTML and CSS files based on the wireframe provided by Codecademy.

All of the images were also provided by the great people at Codecademy.


## Project Status

Project is: _no longer being worked on_. But maybe I consider adding more
features to this project in near future.


## Room for Improvement

I think that this project can be improved by improving or adding the features
below:

- Making the page responsive
- Adding a hamburger menu
- Adding more content to the page
- The style of the page can still be improved


## Acknowledgements
